Hi, All ! :wave:
Currently learning data science and machine learning from various source. I also published my journey of learning at Medium (https://www.medium.com/@rizkyramadhana26).

My learning source recommendations:
1. Kelas Terbuka (Youtube Channel) (Basic Python)
2. https://www.dataquest.io (its free trial helped a lot on learning NumPy :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:)
3. Do a lot of exercise :smile:
